Modes of operation
******************

The *Nuts Discovery Service* currently has only 1 mode of operation: local development. In the future it will support production and other modes.

Local development
=================

The local development mode is targeted at running a Nuts network locally. To prevent any manual configuration, the *Nuts Discovery Service* will auto-sign all certificate signing requests it receives.
